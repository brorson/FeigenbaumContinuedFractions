The stuff in this directory involves computing the continued
fraction expansion of the constant delta.  This is the classical
formula delta = a1 + 1/(a2 + 1/(a3 + ....

The output of the program is the sequence a1, a2, a3, ...

I make a plot of a vs. order.  If the continued fraction was
periodic I would observe periodicity in the plot.  However,
I see none.

The python program uses the value of delta from Andrea Molteni's
website to get the value of delta:

I also compute the Khinchin constant as described in
